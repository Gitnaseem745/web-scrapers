# 🛤️ Web Scraping Roadmap - by Naseem

A structured path from beginner to advanced scraping skills using **Node.js** and related tools.

---

## ✅ Level 1 — Solid Foundation: Basic of Web Scraping

### 📦 Tools:
- `axios`, `cheerio` (for static sites)
- `puppeteer` (for dynamic JS-rendered sites)

### 🧠 Skills:
- Scraping HTML content (`.text()`, `innerText`, `href`, etc.)
- Looping through content
- Handling pagination with next links
- Saving data to `.json` files
- Understanding page lifecycle (`waitForSelector`, `networkidle`, etc.)

---

## 🔍 Level 2 — Intermediate: What’s Beyond the Basics?

### 🔄 Dynamic Actions:
- Clicking buttons (`page.click`)
- Typing in forms (`page.type`)
- Submitting forms and waiting for navigation (`page.waitForNavigation`)

### ⬇️ Infinite Scroll:
- Auto-scroll pages like Twitter or Instagram
- Detect when to stop loading more content

### 🔗 Nested Scraping:
- Visit links from a main page (e.g. blog listings → each post)
- Scrape additional detail from inside each page

### 🕵️ Evading Detection:
- Use stealth plugins (`puppeteer-extra`)
- Change user agents, add random delays
- Headless detection bypass

### 🌐 Proxy Support:
- Rotate proxies or IPs
- Avoid 403/429 blocks on aggressive scraping

### 🧪 Error Handling:
- Retry on failure, recover from timeouts
- Handle 404s and blank data
- Use `try/catch` with smart retry logic

---

## 🚀 Level 3 — Deep Dive: Advanced Scraping

### 📦 Store Results:
- Save to CSV, Excel, MongoDB, MySQL, or Google Sheets
- Upload scraped data via API
- Serve scraped data through your own API

### 🌍 Build Scraping Tools:
- Build CLI tools (Node.js scrapers via terminal)
- Schedule scraping jobs using cron (every X minutes)
- Build scraping APIs (e.g. `express + puppeteer`)

### 🚫 Sites with Protection:
Scraping advanced sites like:
- Cloudflare-protected sites (JS challenges, hCaptcha)
- Login-restricted content (e.g. Amazon, Facebook)
- Paywalled articles

### 🛠️ Alternate Tools:
- 🧪 `Playwright` (a powerful Puppeteer alternative)
- 🧪 `Selenium` (legacy but still powerful)
- 🐍 `BeautifulSoup` (Python's Cheerio equivalent)
- 🕸️ `Scrapy` (Python framework for large-scale scraping)

> ✅ Stay consistent, learn by doing, and always follow the legal & ethical guidelines when scraping websites.
